"[1] The documentation (:help v_R) says "In a next version it might work
"    differently."
"
"[2] Z in visual mode waits for a following key, as seen if 'showcmd' is set.
"    However, neither ZZ nor ZQ do anything (as in normal mode), and no other
"    key combination is listed in the index, so it appears that Z actually does
"    nothing in visual mode.
