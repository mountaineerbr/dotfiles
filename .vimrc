"Note:	map = all modes
" 	   vmap = for
" 	   |------ visual(vmap) and
" 	   |------ select mode(xmap)
"
" :map and :noremap are recursive and non-recursive versions
" of the various mapping commands. What that means is that if you do:
"	:map j gg
"	:map Q j
"	:noremap W j
" j will be mapped to gg; Q will also be mapped to gg, because j will be
" expanded for the recursive mapping. W will be mapped to j (and not to gg)
" because j will not be expanded for the non-recursive mapping.

"
"
"Note: The only suggestion I have is not just using a single prefix like <leader>
"and instead think of prefixes as logical groupings of functionality.
"so maybe you use <space> for a lot of things, and \ for others,
"and , for yet another grouping of mappings. i don't use <leader> at all, but there are bad (yes, I think it's bad) plugins that ship with <leader> as a default <Plug> mapping. if that is your case, still set your leader, but for the mappings you write yourself, consider using explicit <space> or otherwise.
"
"
"Note: In insert mode, <C-o> allows you to execute normal mode commands
"without leaving insert mode.

"[1] The documentation (:help v_R) says "In a next version it might work
"    differently."
"
"[2] Z in visual mode waits for a following key, as seen if 'showcmd' is set.
"    However, neither ZZ nor ZQ do anything (as in normal mode), and no other
"    key combination is listed in the index, so it appears that Z actually does
"    nothing in visual mode.
