exec /usr/bin/Xorg -nolisten tcp "$@" vt$XDG_VTNR

#to run xorg as a regular user, issue:
#$ startx
#or if #xserverrc is configured:
#$ xinit -- :1
#
#in order to maintain an authenticated session with logind and to prevent 
#bypassing the screen locker by switching terminals, xorg has to be started 
#on the same virtual terminal where the login occurred. therefore it is 
#recommended to specify vt$XDG_VTNR
#
#note: to re-enable redirection of the output from x session into the xorg 
#log file, add -keeptty . see xorg#session log redirection for details.

#6.6. remote clients can't connect
#the x server now uses -nolisten tcp by default, which increases the security
#of the x server by not opening a tcp/ip socket.
#use the -listen tcp option to allow the x server to open a tcp/ip socket
